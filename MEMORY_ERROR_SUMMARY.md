# Memory Error Summary & Solution

## The Real Problem

You have plenty of resources (A100 40GB GPU, 80GB RAM, 237GB disk), but the model is being **dequantized** from 4-bit to 16-bit because your system lacks proper Triton support for MXFP4 quantization.

### What's Happening:
1. **Model Size**: OpenAI GPT-OSS-20B is ~13.76GB in MXFP4 (4-bit) format
2. **Without Triton**: Model gets dequantized to bf16 → **55GB+** (4x larger!)
3. **Result**: 55GB > 40GB GPU memory = Out of Memory Error

### Why 4-bit is Better Than 8-bit:
- **4-bit (MXFP4)**: ~3.5-4GB on GPU - Perfect for A100!
- **8-bit**: ~7-8GB on GPU - Still fits but uses more memory
- **16-bit (dequantized)**: ~55GB+ - Doesn't fit!

## Quick Solution

Run the 4-bit fixed script which will:
1. Install Triton >= 3.4.0 (required for MXFP4)
2. Keep the model in 4-bit format
3. Use only ~4GB of GPU memory

```bash
# Run this - it will install Triton if needed
python run_competition_4bit_fixed.py
```

If it says "Triton installed/upgraded", just run it again.

## Alternative Solutions (If 4-bit Fails)

### Option 1: Manual Triton Install
```bash
pip install triton>=3.4.0
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True
python run_competition.py
```

### Option 2: Use 8-bit Quantization (Fallback)
```bash
pip install bitsandbytes
python run_competition_8bit.py
```

### Option 3: Memory-Efficient Loading
```bash
python run_competition_memory_efficient.py
```

## Expected Memory Usage

With proper setup:
- **4-bit MXFP4**: ~3.5-4GB GPU memory ✅ (Best!)
- **8-bit**: ~7-8GB GPU memory ✅ (Good fallback)
- **16-bit (broken)**: ~55GB+ GPU memory ❌ (Current issue)

## Why This Happened

The error message told us:
```
MXFP4 quantization requires triton >= 3.4.0 and kernels installed, 
we will default to dequantizing the model to bf16
```

This means your model was being expanded from efficient 4-bit to memory-hungry 16-bit format!

## TL;DR

Your A100 40GB is more than enough! Just run:
```bash
python run_competition_4bit_fixed.py
```

This keeps the model in its original 4-bit format, using only ~4GB of your 40GB GPU memory.
